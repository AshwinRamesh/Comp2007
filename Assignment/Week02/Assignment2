//DFS implemented for cut verticies


//Cut Verticies Algorithm:

run DFS on G to compute T and d[u for eac u in V
answer = 0
if root r of T has two or more childre then
	add r to answer
for v internal node of T:
	for each child v of u in T:
		if down&up[v] = d[u]:
			answer.append(u)
return answer
